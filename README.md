# password-manager
This is a simple password manager I made using Python.

To use this program, simply input the application the account will be used for dan the username. For the password, the user will be given two choices: manually input the password
or let the program randomly generate a password (8-15 length) for the user.

The credentials will then be encrypted and saved into a .txt file that the user can access anytime.
